== Description ==

Checks how many products added to a WPeC Cart are actually purchased and stores informations in the database.  
It's in very early stage and maybe a bit messy, in particular the ghart.php that outputs js, so if you find
anything wrong let me know :)

Even if you remove the plugin data remain in the DB so remember to delete the *_cart_analytics table too!
